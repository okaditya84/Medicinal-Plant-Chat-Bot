# Medicinal Plant Chat Bot

This is a part of the project developed in SSIP 2.0.
The main project was to enhance and solve the problem of low level retailers and farmers being scammed by capitalists for being sold fake Medicinal plant products.

This is an AI enabled system to help people identify the real species, health, uses, benefits and side effects of a medicinal plant.
The system is able to identify correct plant species in real time using on-board Deep learning algorithms and Neural Networks with an accuracy of 86%.
The system also has an integrated smart chat bot to answer any user queries and to describe them more about the plant species so identified.

The identifier system is trained on more than 15000 images of traditional and exotic medicinal plants and the chat bot is trained on more than 400 PDF material from books, authorized online sources and govt. datasets.

#### Results: The response time for the identifier is less than 5 seconds in real-time. The QA retrieval time of the chat is less than 40 seconds, which can be brought down to about 20 seconds with more hardware advanced GPU and CPU machines.

#### Use case: This can be used in local mandis in villages and in Ayurvedic centers of any city to cross check and verify the actual statistics of the herbs being utilized, reduce the fake trade of herbal products.

#### Further aim: We aim to enhance the accuracy to the best of the technology's potential and also to make it freely available for the public, collaborating with the Ministry of Ayush, India.
